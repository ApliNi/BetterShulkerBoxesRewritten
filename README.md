# Better Shulker Boxes _Rewritten_
Better Shulker Boxes is a Spigot plugin for Minecraft that allows
players to open shulker boxes more easily, by right-clicking while holding them
or just right-clicking them in the inventory.

The plugin is 100% customizable, you can change or disable the
shulker open/close sounds and messages.

This project currently supports Spigot and PaperSpigot versions 1.13 and above,
only the latest builds are supported. The plugin will most probably work on custom forks,
but it is not guaranteed.
